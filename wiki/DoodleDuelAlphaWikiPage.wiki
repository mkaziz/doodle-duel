Doodle Duel - While the duel phase of the game has not been implemented, the player must navigate across different platforms while trying to keep going as high as possible. They should try to jump on as many trampolines as possible while avoiding hitting the enemy bears they encounter in mid-air!




--You can change your character after pressing the initial "Play Game" and going to "Change Character". Choose between a chicken, cow and dog.

--Pause the game at any time by hitting "Escape", and then navigate to either "Resume" or "Exit".

--The doodle jumps automatically in one spot unless the user uses an arrow-key input to move it's coordinates.

--The doodle can move in the +/- y direction by using the Right and Left arrow keys (this is to navigate from platform to platform and avoid the enemy doodles).

--The doodle can move in the +/y z direction by using the Up and Down arrow keys (this is to help avoid the enemy doodles and to position themselves well to jump onto trampolines to give them boosts).

--Making contact with an enemy doodle ends the game.

--There is an "Options" menu in the beginning when the game begins but those options are dummy options for the menu and don't change anything.





Enjoy the game!! :)
